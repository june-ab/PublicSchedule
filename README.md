# PublicSchedule
Repository for the open standard of interchanging metadata, broadcast events and rights, called Public Schedule.

Public Schedule is an XML format, for distributing data within TV and media business. It's purpuse is to have a common
open standard for exhanging information between internal systems at a broadcaster or distributor, as well as exhanging
this type of data between organizations.

#The XML structure in brief
The XML format of Public schedule is divided in three different areas:

Content contains metadata of programs, such as for example title, synopsis, image and participating actors.
Material contains technical data of the transmission or video file, such as aspect ratio, resolution and subtitling. 
Material also contains rights for the programs, for example if it is allowed to be viewed on a tablet or allowed to 
recorded and be available on demand.
Event contains information about the transmission of the program on a linear channel, such as the channel's name, 
when the transmission starts and ends.

#History
Public Schedule was invented by a joined effort from two of the major TV-channels in Sweden. The reason behind the effort was the lack of a common standard within this area, that
also would enable to exchange information of new demands within the TV-area. It was also important that this would
be kept an open standard, not proprietary to any of the founders, and that the format should evolve over time. 
Seeking broad acceptance for Public Schedule is also important for enabling it as a standard.

The founders was TV4 and SVT. TeliaSonera, one of the major distributors in the Nordics, was an early adopter of the standard. When it was time do develop the next version 4 of Public Schedule, TeliaSonera took the lead, and it was also at this time as June was involved as contributor.

TerracomBoxer, one of the other major distributors in the Nordic is also supporting this standard, and when there was
a need to let this standard be supervised by an external, independant organization, June was asked to perform this task.
